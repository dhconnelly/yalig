yet another lisp in go
======================

recursive-descent parser and tree-walking interpreter for a simple
lisp disalect. see fib.lisp for an example of what's supported.

- ints: +, -, =, <
- strings: print
- lists: first, rest, cons, empty
- null
- fn: lambdas w/capturing (closures)
- if, seq, def, defun

to run it:

    go build
    ./yalig fib.lisp
